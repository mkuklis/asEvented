## Description

asEvented is a micro event emitter which provides the observer pattern to JavaScript object. 
It works in the browser and server (node.js). The code follows a functional mixins pattern described by Angus Croll [a-fresh-look-at-javascript-mixins](http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/a-fresh-look-at-javascript-mixins).


## Usage

In browser include single JavaScript file:
 
    <script src="asevented.js"></script>

On server install asEvented via npm first:
   
    npm install asEvented

and then include it in your project with:

    var asEvented = require('asEvented');


##Example Usage
Define the constructor which will make use of asEvented:
    
    function Model() {
      this.id = 0;
    }

Add (mixin) asEvented functionality to Model with:
   
    asEvented.call(Model.prototype);

model now has access to **trigger**, **bind** and **unbind** functions

Add some functions to Model:

    Model.prototype.setId = function (id) {
      this.id = id;
      this.trigger('change:id', id); // Model has now access to trigger
    }

Create a new object and bind to `change:id` event:

    var model = new Model();
    model.bind('change:id', function (id) {
      console.log('id changed to: ' +  id);
    });

Set a few model ids in order to trigger `change:id` event:
    
    model.setId(1);
    model.setId(2);
    model.setId(3);

A single handler can be bound to multiple events by separating the events by spaces, though it will be ignorant of the triggering event:

    model.bind('change:id change:pass', function() {
      console.log('Event called.');
    });

And multiple events can be unbound in one call:

    model.unbind('onload onready');
